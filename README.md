# Pacman Agent Design Project

**Introduction**

In this project, I have designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, I have implemented both minimax and expectimax search algorithms and evaluation function design.


**Getting Started
**

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

4. Run the autograder with the command:

**Copy code
**
python autograder.py

**Note**: If your default Python interpreter refers to Python 2.7, you may need to use python3 autograder.py.

**Usage**

Running Autograder

You can run the autograder for all questions or for a specific question using the following commands:

**Copy code
**


python autograder.py -q q2

Running Specific Tests

You can run specific tests by providing the path to the test case. For example:

**Copy code


**python autograder.py -t test_cases/q2/0-small-tree

**Graphics Options
**
By default, the autograder displays graphics when running specific tests (-t option) but does not display graphics when running all questions (-q option). You can force graphics using the --graphics flag or force no graphics using the --no-graphics flag.
